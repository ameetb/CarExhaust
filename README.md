# CarExhaust
On of the best parts of driving a high end sports car is the sound from the powerful engine and carefully designed exhaust system. 
CarExhaust provides allows users to feel like they are driving a high performance supercar simply by connecting their android device to 
their car's stereo system. Another application for CarExhaust is for drivers of electric cars who want to be able to enjoy the 
sound of an engine that matches with their driving.

This android app uses GPS to determine the user's speed and acceleration and play the corresponding exhaust sounds from a supercar using a set of pre determined audio files. The app currently features exhaust sounds from a Jaguar F-Type, but exhaust sounds from other cars can easily be added.
