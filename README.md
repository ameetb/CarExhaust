# CarExhaust
On of the best parts of driving a high end sports car is the sound from the powerful engine and carefully designed exhaust system. 
CarExhaust provides allows users to feel like they are driving a high performance supercar simply by connecting their android device to 
their car's stereo system. This android app uses GPS to play the exhaust sounds from a supercar that correspond to the acceleration and 
speed of the user's car using a set of pre determined audio files. The app currently features exhaust sounds from a Jaguar F-Type, but other 
cars' exhaust sounds can easily be added.
